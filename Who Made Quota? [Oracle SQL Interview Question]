----------------

As a data analyst on the Oracle Sales Operations team, you are given a list of salespeopleâ€™s deals, and the annual quota they need to hit.

Write a query that outputs each employee id and whether they hit the quota or not ('yes' or 'no'). Order the results by employee id in ascending order.

Definitions:

deal_size: Deals acquired by a salesperson in the year. Each salesperson may have more than 1 deal.
quota: Total annual quota for each salesperson.
deals Table:
Column Name	Type
employee_id	integer
deal_size	integer
deals Example Input:
employee_id	deal_size
101	400000
101	300000
201	500000
301	500000
sales_quotas Table:
Column Name	Type
employee_id	integer
quota	integer
sales_quotas Example Input:
employee_id	quota
101	500000
201	400000
301	600000
Example Output:
employee_id	made_quota
101	yes
201	yes
301	no
Explanation:
User 101 had $700k in sales, beating their $500k quota. User 201 had $500k in sales, beating their $400k quota. User 301 had $500k in sales, but had a $600k quota, so they didn't hit their goal.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
