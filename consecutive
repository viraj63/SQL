from logs)

select distinct num as ConsecutiveNums from cte where num=n1 and n1=n2

----------------
select distinct(l1.num) as ConsecutiveNums
from logs l1,logs l2, logs l3
where l1.id=l2.id- 1 and l2.id=l3.id-1 and l1.num=l2.num and l2.num=l3.num;

| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
