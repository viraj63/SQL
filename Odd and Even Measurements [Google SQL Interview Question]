Method_1: with cte as(
select cast(measurement_time as date) as measurement_day ,measurement_value, RANK() over(PARTITION BY cast(measurement_time as date) order by measurement_time)
as measurements_num
from measurements )

select measurement_day,
sum(measurement_value) filter (where measurements_num%2!=0 ) as odd_sum,
sum(measurement_value) filter (where measurements_num%2=0 ) as even_sum
from cte  
group by measurement_day;



Method  2:SELECT 
date(measurement_time) as measurement_day,
measurement_value,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY date(measurement_time) ORDER BY measurement_time) AS RN
FROM measurements
)

SELECT 
measurement_day,
SUM(CASE WHEN RN%2 = 1 THEN measurement_value END) AS odd_sum,
SUM(CASE WHEN RN%2 = 0 THEN measurement_value END) AS even_sum
FROM CTE 
GROUP BY measurement_day;

Assume you're given a table with measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day.

Write a query to calculate the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and display the results in two different columns. Refer to the Example Output below for the desired format.

Definition:

Within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.
Effective April 15th, 2023, the question and solution for this question have been revised.

measurements Table:
Column Name	Type
measurement_id	integer
measurement_value	decimal
measurement_time	datetime
measurements Example Input:
measurement_id	measurement_value	measurement_time
131233	1109.51	07/10/2022 09:00:00
135211	1662.74	07/10/2022 11:00:00
523542	1246.24	07/10/2022 13:15:00
143562	1124.50	07/11/2022 15:00:00
346462	1234.14	07/11/2022 16:45:00
Example Output:
measurement_day	odd_sum	even_sum
07/10/2022 00:00:00	2355.75	1662.74
07/11/2022 00:00:00	1124.50	1234.14
Explanation
Based on the results,

On 07/10/2022, the sum of the odd-numbered measurements is 2355.75, while the sum of the even-numbered measurements is 1662.74.
On 07/11/2022, there are only two measurements available. The sum of the odd-numbered measurements is 1124.50, and the sum of the even-numbered measurements is 1234.14.
