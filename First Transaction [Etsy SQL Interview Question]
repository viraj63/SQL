with cte as (select user_id, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id  order by transaction_date) as p, transaction_date,spend 
from user_transactions )

select count(DISTINCT user_id) as users
from cte 
where p=1 and spend>=50

This is the same question as problem #9 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table containing Etsy user transactions. Write a query that retrieves the customers whose first transaction was valued at $50 or more. Output the total number of users who meet this criteria.

Instructions:

To determine the first transaction for each user, use the transaction_date field.
Take into account scenarios where a user had multiple transactions on the same day. Use a specific function (we can't give too much away ðŸ˜‰) to handle these cases and correctly identify the first transaction.
Effective June 14th, 2023, the solution and hints have been revised.

user_transactions Table:
Column Name	Type
transaction_id	integer
user_id	integer
spend	decimal
transaction_date	timestamp
user_transactions Example Input:
transaction_id	user_id	spend	transaction_date
759274	111	49.50	02/03/2022 00:00:00
850371	111	51.00	03/15/2022 00:00:00
615348	145	36.30	03/22/2022 00:00:00
137424	156	151.00	04/04/2022 00:00:00
248475	156	87.00	04/16/2022 00:00:00
Example Output:
users
1
Explanation:
Among all the users, only user ID 156 had their first transaction valued at over $50.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
