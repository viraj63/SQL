Method_1:
select category,product,total_spend
FROM
(
select category,product,SUM(spend) as total_spend,
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY category 
      ORDER BY SUM(spend) DESC) AS ranking 
from product_spend
where EXTRACT(year FROM transaction_date) =2022
group by product,category
) as ranked_spen
where ranking<=2
ORDER BY category,ranking ;

method_2: using CTE
With rank_spe AS (
select category,product,SUM(spend) as total_spend,
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY category 
      ORDER BY SUM(spend) DESC) AS ranking 
from product_spend
where EXTRACT(year FROM transaction_date) =2022
group by product,category
)



select category,product,total_spend
from rank_spe
where ranking<=2
ORDER BY category,ranking ;

This is the same question as problem #12 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given a table containing data on Amazon customers and their spending on products in different category, write a query to identify the top two highest-grossing products within each category in the year 2022. The output should include the category, product, and total spend.

product_spend Table:
Column Name	Type
category	string
product	string
user_id	integer
spend	decimal
transaction_date	timestamp
product_spend Example Input:
category	product	user_id	spend	transaction_date
appliance	refrigerator	165	246.00	12/26/2021 12:00:00
appliance	refrigerator	123	299.99	03/02/2022 12:00:00
appliance	washing machine	123	219.80	03/02/2022 12:00:00
electronics	vacuum	178	152.00	04/05/2022 12:00:00
electronics	wireless headset	156	249.90	07/08/2022 12:00:00
electronics	vacuum	145	189.00	07/15/2022 12:00:00
Example Output:
category	product	total_spend
appliance	refrigerator	299.99
appliance	washing machine	219.80
electronics	vacuum	341.00
electronics	wireless headset	249.90
Explanation:
Within the "appliance" category, the top two highest-grossing products are "refrigerator" and "washing machine."

In the "electronics" category, the top two highest-grossing products are "vacuum" and "wireless headset."
