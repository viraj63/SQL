----------------------------
Apple has a trade-in program where their customers can return the old iPhone device to Apple and Apple gives the customers the trade-in value (known as payout) of the device in cash.

For each store, write a query of the total revenue from the trade-in. Order the result by the descending order.

trade_in_transactions Table:
Column Name	Type
transaction_id	integer
model_id	integer
store_id	integer
transaction_date	date
trade_in_transactions Example Input:
transaction_id	model_id	store_id	transaction_date
1	112	512	01/01/2022
2	113	512	01/01/2022
trade_in_payouts Table:
Column Name	Type
model_id	integer
model_name	string
payout_amount	integer
trade_in_payouts Example Input:
model_id	model_name	payout_amount
111	iPhone 11	200
112	iPhone 12	350
113	iPhone 13	450
114	iPhone 13 Pro Max	650
Example Output:
store_id	payout_total
512	800
Explanation:
Store 512 had 2 trade-ins: iPhone 12 and 13, so the total payout is 800 (350 + 450).

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
