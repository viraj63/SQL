--------------------
This is the same question as problem #27 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you are given the table below containing information on user reviews. Write a query to obtain the number and percentage of businesses that are top rated. A top-rated busines is defined as one whose reviews contain only 4 or 5 stars.

Output the number of businesses and percentage of top rated businesses rounded to the nearest integer.

Assumption:

Each business has only one review (which is the business' average rating).
P.S. It's an Easy question, so keep your solution simple and short! ðŸ˜‰
